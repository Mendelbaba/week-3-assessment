How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

The basic gist (according to my limited knowledge) is that the internet is a bunch of local machines that are connected and send information through cables buried under the ocean. our local machine has its own ip address and it can send information to another machine using their ip address as the target (i forgot to explain ip addresses... the way our computers are able to target one another accurately is through ip addresses, which is like a home address, but its for identifying machines). There are languages that are utilized to exchange that information. And just like information can be sent, it can also be requested. So when I click a link, my computer sends out a request for the information hosted on another machine when that request is recieved by that computer at that ip address it sends back the requested information (this is all done using http language I believe). Our browsers are what take that information and decode it to display it in a readable way. Thank you for attending my TED talk.
